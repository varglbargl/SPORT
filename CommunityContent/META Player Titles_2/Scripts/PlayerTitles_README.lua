	Player Titles allows game creators to give special roles to themselves, dedicated players, and anyone they deem fit
	for recognition. With a simple module it's easy to dictate and customize a hierarchy of roles. A set of user interface
	components shows this special recognition for everyone: playerlist, scoreboard, and nameplate.


1.	Setup

	1)	Edit the PlayerTitles module (Project Content > Imported Content > Player Titles > PlayerTitles) to include you
		and anyone else you want to give special titles to.
	2)	Insert the player MUIDs into the tables; documentation is provided in the script.
	3)	Drag and drop either a "PlayerList", "PlayerNameplates", or "Scoreboard" into the hierarchy (or all three!)
	4)	Alter custom properties as you wish!


2.	Usage

	Simply edit the PlayerTitles module to include yourself as a game creator (instructions provided) and drag-and-drop
	any of the templates (PlayerList, PlayerNameplates, Scoreboard) into the hierarchy.


3.	PlayerTitles

	This contains all of the possible social titles and their respective assignments. More documentation can be found in
	the script itself.


3b.	PlayerList

	A "PlayerList" is a compact UI panel listing players and their corresponding teams and titles.


3c.	Player Nameplates

	A "PlayerNameplate" is text above a player's head indicating their username, health, and titles.


3d.	Scoreboard

	A "Scoreboard" is a large UI panel listing players and their corresponding teams and titles alongside additional
	stats, such as kills, deaths, or even resources.


4.	Discord
